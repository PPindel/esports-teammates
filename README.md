- Esports Teammates is a site created for people who like to play online, but couldn't find right teammates yet
- By creating a post, you can select your game, and describe your exerience, gaming skills and times preffered to play with your mates
- Easy to operate, easy to navigate, intuitive and well designed site for all gamers!

# UX
## Target Audience
Esports Teammates is designed to be attractive to the gaming community.
It reflects the popular design of gaming accessories (illuminating leds for PCs, keyboards, mouses, etc.).
The site is easy to operate and navigate, the content is clear and users can communicate with themselves to find new online friends!

## Design Choices
### Colors
![image](https://github.com/PPindel/esports-teammates/assets/114284732/c0967ae8-0651-4f6b-8535-be232ec512e2)

The pallet inspiration was taken from coolors.co.
However, some of the colors had to be adjusted to match the contrast standard in the Lighthouse validator.

The idea of colors was to be an 80's arcade vibe to reflect the gaming theme of the site.

# Agile Process
## Project Goals
- users can create and read posts (TeamAds)
- users can edit and delete their posts
- users can comment created posts
- users can edit and delete their own comments
- admin can do all of the above for any post or comment

## Initial User Stories
https://github.com/users/PPindel/projects/4
All user stories are marked to show the importance.
I used MoScOw prioritization to reduce down to an MVP.

## Scope
When I started my project I was very ambitious to develop a complete portal for gamers to search online for friends, teams and improve their skills. I imagined custom applications, profiles, filtering tools, game sections, guilds, and many more...
But in the middle of developing, I realized that this may take much more time than I had to make it good.
I've created a functional website working similarly to a blog website where people can connect and make an advert. All previous ideas are still in GitHub user stories for this project.

## Future Features
- team apply button and form. Currently, users can apply to join a team by comments, in the future I am planning to create an application form for this
- search filter on top of the page to display particular game or skill level
- Team Ad owners will be able to accept od reject a joing team application
- more games and templates (as different games have different options, positions, etc.)
- upgrade profile page so users can ad a description, skill level, favourite games, and comment counter

# Defects
- my first defect was revealing the secret code to the github. Currently, the secred code is changed and protected, and the project is safe (occured on 14th of March, fixed on 14th of March)
- author tag was not displaying correctly (occured on 29th of March, fixed on 29th of March)
- no redirection after submitting the ad (occured on 29th of March, fixed on 29th of March)
- no authentications for Team Ad authors (anyone could edit the ad) (occured on 17th of April, fixed on 17th of April)
- logo for small devices was too wide, so the site wasn't looking good (occured on 31st of May, fixed on 31st of May)

## Defects of Note
![image](https://github.com/PPindel/esports-teammates/assets/114284732/431bbfed-3330-455e-b5b7-08fbcae1a6bf)

When I encountered this bug, I was seriously afraid.
After typing only special chars in title of the TeamAd, the whole site crashed, and all I could see was 500 error.
Changes in gitpod didn't work, I had to remove the fatal post via admin panel and then restrict title to alphanumeric only to prevent this happen again.
That's why you can see some special chars in old posts, but currently it is blocked.

## Outstanding Defects
- Logo and navbar sometimes behaves weird in the Safari browser (not always, that's why I deceided to fix this bug in the future)

>  - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<YOUR_VALUE>"
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`
